## Encryption Keys

Some Ren'Py archives are encrypted. If you encounter an error when opening an archive (zlib or pickle errors), you may need to enter the encryption key:

1. Click the "Encryption Key" button in the sidebar
2. Enter the hex key (e.g., `0x12345678`)
3. Click Apply
4. Try opening the archive again

The encryption key is typically found in the game's source files (look for `.rpy` files containing archive definitions).

## File Type Support

### Preview Support

| Type | Formats |
|------|---------|
| Video | webm, mp4, mkv, avi, ogv, mov, flv |
| Image | png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, webp, tga |
| Audio | mp3, wav, ogg, flac, aac, opus |

### Extraction

All file types in the archive can be extracted, including scripts, fonts, and other game assets.

## Tips

- Use the search box to quickly find specific files
- Ctrl+Click multiple files, then press Q to add them all to the queue at once
- Set loop counts in the queue for repeated playback of specific clips
- The timeline editor auto-places clips on the appropriate track (video/image on video track, audio on audio track)

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"

The application requires Python 3 to be installed and accessible from the command line. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Archive fails to open with zlib/pickle error

The archive is likely encrypted. Enter the encryption key using the "Encryption Key" button in the sidebar.

### Videos don't play

Some video formats may not be supported by the built-in player. Try extracting the file and opening it with an external media player.

### Preview not loading

If preview shows a loading spinner indefinitely, check the console for errors (View > Toggle Developer Tools). The file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format.
